### Overview
Identify job postings as being legitimate or fraudulent based on text values in the description, requirements, and other values accompanying the job posting. Similar to how fraudulent news stories can deceive, there are fraudulent job postings, postings that even knowledgeable individuals fall for. While it may cause a minor hindrance of costing time, it can turn worse for more troublesome postings that are asking for money or stealing credit information from the person applying. Our objective is to aid job applicants in recognizing fake job postings and avoiding them altogether.
